# Bump version

This action bumps package versions based on the repository's commit messages written according to the Conventional Commits specification. It assumes [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) are already setup, see the [setup Python action](../setup-python/README.md) and [setup Commitizen action](../setup-commitizen/README.md) for ready to use actions to do this.
