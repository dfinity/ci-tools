# Setup Commitizen action

This actions sets up [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) for use in actions. It assumes [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are already setup, see the [setup Python action](../setup-python/README.md) for a ready to use action to do this.

## Example usage

```yaml
name: Setup Commitizen

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  setup_commitizen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: 'Setup Python'
        uses: dfinity/ci-tools/actions/setup-python@main

      - name: 'Setup Commitizen'
        uses: dfinity/ci-tools/actions/setup-commitizen@main
```
